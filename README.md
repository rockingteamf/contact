Completed :
1. If the e down Options are "standard" I do not need the second drop down box. We can remove that across the
system, in admin side and dealer side. also packing slip should reflect the changes. ( Resolved )

2. Another thing I no ced that I believe I men oned before our 30 days for tes ng is the email total doesn't correlate
with the actual total. ( Resolved )

3. In the admin section, we need billing address to be automacally populated with the details that the customer enters into their profile. ( Resolved and Have A Query)
    QUERY : Is this functionality aldo required for other users rather than admin ?

4. We noticed that the phone number that we enter when crea ng an order is not shown later on in the system.( Resolved )

5. When I click My Orders in Front End a error occured ( Resolved )

If an order is deleted from the admin side. It should make a note in the dealer side that the "order was deleted by admin" and should not give them that op on to click the arrow.
( Delection is not possible for admin and THere is a option For DECLINE and in front end ,we were Mentioned it. )

6. Please see a ached video. When a non-admin user goes into modify screen and clicks "cancel this order" he gets to
see and modify the "orders wai ng for approval" page. If a non-admin user clicks cancel it should tell him "he does not
have the permissions please contact and admin for assistance"   ( Resolved )




Remainging :

1. Another thing I would like to change is "Fold direc on". If customer enter the same number in "a" and "b" dimension
then fold direc on doesn't ma er. But if customers enter a different number in those two fields Program should no fy
customer to select a "fold direc on"...... same goes for the admin sec on. I will let you and your team decide exactly
how to make that work. Please let me know if you have any ques ons regarding this. as this is a minor update that I
believe will save some errors later on.

2. When admin is "adding order quickly" if admit should try and change screens and do something else in the
middle of processing an order, System should ask if admin will like to discard order and navigate away from that
page. Then clear the cart when admin comes back into the cart.


Suggestions


Another thing Jamir, is when we print the packing slips. In the 4"x6" labels it seems like you have a li le more space
you can use. Just wanted to let you know that so maybe you can magnify the sheet a li le bit.
